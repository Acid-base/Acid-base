Hi, I'm Daniel Yates

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me

I'm a fledgling web dev just picking up the craft again after a years-long hiatus that began on a day I could no longer deny my heart and head just weren't in it at the time. During this period I kept my ear to the ground in the tech world and developed some critical systems level and domain knowledge that I was sorely lacking when I last started. I'm passionate about building dynamic web applications and expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving  world of technology, and in my time I'll make a few things that matter and make a real difference for someone, bet on it
